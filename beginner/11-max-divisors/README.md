# Exercise 11: Number with the Most Divisors

Write a Python program to:
- Read 20 numbers from standard input.
- For each number, calculate the number of its divisors (مقسوم علیه‌ها).
- Output the number with the highest number of divisors and the number of its divisors, separated by a space.
- If multiple numbers have the same (maximum) number of divisors, print the largest one.

## Requirements

- Use a function `count_divisors(n)` that receives an integer and returns the number of its divisors.

## Input Format

20 lines, each containing one integer.

## Output Format

One line containing the number with the most divisors and the count, separated by a space.

## Example

**Input:**
767

665

999

895

907

796

561

914

555

529

672

933

882

869

801

660

879

985

**Output:**
672 24


## How to Run

```bash
python max_divisors.py
