# Exercise 13: Sum of Numbers (Sorting for School Kids)

Write a Python program to:
- Read an input string of numbers separated by `+` (numbers will only be 1, 2, or 3, and no spaces).
- Output the same numbers, but sorted in non-decreasing order and still joined by `+`.

## Example

**Input:**
1+1+3+1+3


**Output:**
1+1+1+3+3


## How to Run

```bash
python sum_of_numbers.py
