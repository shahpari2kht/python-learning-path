# Exercise 06: Age Group Detector

Write a Python program that:
- Reads a positive integer as the user's age.
- Prints the correct age group according to the following:

| Range                | Output      |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| 0 < age < 6          | khordsal    |
| 6 ≤ age < 10         | koodak      |
| 10 ≤ age < 14        | nojavan     |
| 14 ≤ age < 24        | javan       |
| 24 ≤ age < 40        | bozorgsal   |
| age ≥ 40             | miansal     |

**The output must be exactly as shown, all lowercase.**
