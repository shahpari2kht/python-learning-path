# Exercise 09: Find the Oldest Parliament Candidate

Write a Python program to:
- Read ages of Islamic Parliament candidates from standard input (one age per line, each between 10 and 90).
- The program continues reading as long as the input isn't `-1`.
- As soon as `-1` appears, the program should output the largest age entered.

## Input Format

- Each input line is an integer (10 ≤ age ≤ 90).
- Input ends when `-1` is entered.

## Output Format

- Print only the greatest age entered (without any extra text).

## Example

**Input:**
17

15

39

51

**Output:**
