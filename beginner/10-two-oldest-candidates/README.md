# Exercise 10: Find the Oldest and the Second Oldest Parliament Candidate

Write a Python program to:
- Read ages (integers) of parliament candidates from input (each between 10 and 90, all unique).
- Continue reading until `-1` is entered.
- Output the largest age, then the second largest age, separated by a space.

## Input Format

- One integer age per line (10 ≤ age ≤ 90).
- Input ends when entering `-1`.

## Output Format

- Two numbers separated by a space: the largest age and the second largest age.
