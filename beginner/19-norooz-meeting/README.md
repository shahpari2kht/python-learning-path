# Exercise 19: Norooz Meeting

Three friends are located at positions x1, x2, x3 on a line (x-axis).  
They want to meet at a point so that their total travel distance is minimized.  
Calculate the minimum total distance they must travel.

## Input

Three integers separated by spaces (x1 x2 x3).

## Output

Print the minimal total distance as an integer (no decimals).

## Example

**Input**
6 9 10

**Output**
4


## Explanation

If all meet at position 9:
- |6-9| + |9-9| + |10-9| = 3 + 0 + 1 = 4

This is the minimum possible.

## How to Run

```bash
python norooz_meeting.py
